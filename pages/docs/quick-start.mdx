# Quick Start

Getting started with AI i18n is easy and should take no more than a few minutes. If you haven't already, please follow the instructions to register and create your first website/web application project.

<Steps>
### Step 1: Install the code snippet

Copy and paste the following code snippet into the `<head>` tag of your website application's HTML to start using AI i18n.

<Callout emoji="✨" type="info">
  **Replace** `[PROJECT_ID]` and `[API_KEY]` with your Project ID and API Key,
  which can be found on the AI i18n [Projects
  ↗](https://app.aii18n.com/projects) page.
</Callout>

```html filename="copy to <head> tag"
<script
  id="aii18n"
  projectid="[PROJECT_ID]"
  apikey="[API_KEY]"
  src="https://unpkg.com/aii18n@^5.3.1"
></script>
```

### Step 2: Verify Successful Installation

After installing the code snippet in Step 1, refresh your website/application. AI i18n will automatically detect the language of your website/application and send it to the AI i18n management console.

You can verify that the installation was successful by:

- Checking for the terms reported by your website on the AI i18n management console's **Projects** page. If there are terms reported, the installation was successful.
- Checking the console (Chrome/Firefox) for `aii18n` log output. If you see `aii18n: init success`, the installation was successful. 

</Steps>
